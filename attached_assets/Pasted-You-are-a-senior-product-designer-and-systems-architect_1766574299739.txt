You are a senior product designer and systems architect.

Design a standalone web application called a “Style Explorer” that manages visual styles as first-class, standards-based artifacts.

This is NOT an image generator UI.
This is a style intelligence application.

================================================
NON-NEGOTIABLE INVARIANTS
================================================
- Every Style ALWAYS has a comprehensive W3C DTCG 2025.10 design-token JSON.
- No style may exist without tokens.
- Tokens are the source of truth, not prompts.
- Image generation is a consumer of styles, not their definition.

================================================
CORE CONCEPT
================================================
A Style is a reusable, inspectable, comparable object composed of:
- Reference images
- Canonical preview images
- A full W3C DTCG design-token JSON
- AI prompt scaffolding derived from tokens

The UI must make this obvious.

================================================
RESPLIT THE APP INTO 3 MODES
================================================

### 1. STYLE AUTHORING
Purpose: Create a Style.

User flows:
- Upload reference image(s)
- OR generate an image from a prompt (which is immediately tokenized)
- System ALWAYS generates:
  - Full DTCG token JSON
  - Still life preview
  - Landscape preview
  - Portrait preview

UI requirements:
- Clear “Style Creation” boundary
- Token JSON visible (collapsible, read-only by default)
- Explicit messaging: “Tokens are canonical”
- Save is disabled until tokens exist

---

### 2. STYLE EXPLORER
Purpose: Browse and compare styles (Midjourney-style, but explicit).

UI requirements:
- Grid of style cards
- Each card shows:
  - Still life preview
  - Landscape preview
  - Portrait preview
- Consistent preview prompts across all styles
- Ability to:
  - Select a style
  - Inspect tokens
  - Compare styles side-by-side
- Tokens are treated as data, not decoration

The Explorer should feel like a library or vault, not a feed.

---

### 3. STYLE APPLICATION (GENERATION)
Purpose: Use a style to generate an image.

User flows:
- Enter a prompt
- Select exactly one style
- Generate image using:
  - Style reference images
  - Token-derived prompt scaffolding

UI requirements:
- Prompt input is visually secondary to style selection
- Clear indication of which style is active
- Generated image is not a style unless explicitly promoted

---

================================================
VISUAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
================================================
- Calm, neutral, editorial UI
- No “AI hype” visuals
- Data-forward, inspectable layouts
- Clear hierarchy:
  Style > Tokens > Images > Prompt
- Designed for thinking, not scrolling

================================================
DELIVERABLES
================================================
Produce:
1. App-level information architecture
2. Screen breakdown for each mode
3. Key UI components
4. Interaction rules (what is allowed / disallowed)
5. Visual tone guidance

Do NOT:
- Include marketing copy
- Include animations
- Include brand fluff
- Treat tokens as optional

Design this as a serious, long-lived system.
