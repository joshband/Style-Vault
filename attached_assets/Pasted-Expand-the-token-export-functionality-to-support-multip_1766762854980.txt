Expand the token export functionality to support multiple formats (React, Flutter, CSS, etc.).
Task:
1. Review the existing generator code from Copy-That (if available). Identify the functions or templates used to generate different format outputs: e.g., a React theme (probably JSON or JS object), Flutter (Dart code as string), Material (maybe JSON or JS).
2. On the backend, implement routes or logic to produce these formats on demand. One approach: have an endpoint like GET `/api/v1/styles/{id}/export?format=react` which will take the stored tokens and format them. Alternatively, pre-generate and store the outputs in the database when extraction happens (could slow extraction though).
3. Possibly use a library or template engine for this. For example, to generate code, you can have template strings. But given the small size, simple string building is fine.
   - React (JS/TS): output an object like in Copy-That's README example [oai_citation:61‡github.com](https://github.com/joshband/copy-that#:~:text=Generated%20Code%3A).
   - CSS: perhaps generate a CSS file content with custom properties (e.g., `--primary-color: #FFF;` etc).
   - Flutter: output a Dart class or map.
   - W3C JSON: basically the raw design tokens JSON (which you already have).
4. Frontend: create a UI element for export. For instance, on the results panel, add a dropdown or buttons: "Export as: JSON / React / CSS / Flutter ...". When clicked, either call the API to get that format or generate it on client-side if easier (the client has the tokens JSON, it could format small things like CSS or JSON easily without a round trip).
5. If doing on client, implement formatting functions in JS for each type. If doing on server, ensure the response has correct `Content-Type` (e.g., application/json for JSON, text/css for CSS, etc.) and triggers a download.
6. Test each format:
   - JSON: should download a .json file of tokens.
   - React: ideally provide a `.js` or `.ts` file content that looks like a theme module (maybe even include a snippet `export const theme = {...}`).
   - Flutter: provide Dart code snippet (maybe as .dart file content).
   - CSS: a .css file with variables or classes representing the style.
7. If needed, sanitize token names to be valid in each context (e.g., CSS variables can't have spaces, etc.). Copy-That likely already handles naming conventions.
8. This enhancement uses a lot of existing logic from Copy-That (where 17+ generators exist), so leveraging that will save time.
