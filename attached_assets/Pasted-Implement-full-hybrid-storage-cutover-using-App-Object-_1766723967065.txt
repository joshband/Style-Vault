Implement full hybrid storage cutover using App/Object Storage as the canonical image store.

Requirements:
1) New uploads:
   - Store original + thumb + medium in object storage (never Postgres).
   - Generate deterministic object keys per style/asset/variant.

2) DB:
   - Write rows to object_assets:
     (styleId, role/type, variant, objectKey, width, height, mime, size).
   - Remove all base64 image storage from style records.

3) Serving:
   - Add GET endpoints that resolve object_assets to /objects/... URLs and return those URLs to the client.
   - /api/styles returns thumb URLs only.
   - /api/styles/:id returns URLs grouped by role + variant.
   - Never return base64 images.

4) Migration:
   - Create an admin migration that:
     - Reads existing styles.referenceImages + previews + moodBoard + uiConcepts + any image_assets rows.
     - Writes each image to object storage.
     - Generates original + thumb + medium variants.
     - Creates object_assets rows.
     - Updates style records to store only object asset IDs/keys (no base64).
     - Leaves a safe rollback toggle (env var) to temporarily read old base64.

5) Verification (required before migration):
   - Add a command: npm run verify:image-artifacts
   - This command must:
     - Discover all existing image artifacts (legacy style fields + image_assets + existing object_assets).
     - Validate base64 integrity (no invalid/truncated data).
     - Decode and detect image format; verify MIME matches detected content.
     - Read actual width/height; flag mismatches vs stored metadata (if any).
     - Compute SHA-256 hash of decoded bytes; detect duplicates and stale/mismatched assets.
     - Detect partial migrations:
       - object exists but DB row missing
       - DB row exists but object missing
       - style references assets that don’t exist
     - Emit a structured JSON report (summary + per-style issues) and exit non-zero if issues exist.
     - Optionally support a --fix mode ONLY if it is deterministic and safe:
       - recompute missing metadata
       - regenerate thumb/medium from original if original is valid
       - mark irrecoverable assets with explicit warnings (do not silently drop)
   - Migration must refuse to run unless verification passes (or a FORCE flag is explicitly set).

6) Delete flow:
   - Deleting a style deletes all related object_assets rows and deletes corresponding objects in storage.
   - No orphaned objects allowed.

Acceptance criteria:
- /api/styles and /api/styles/:id never return base64 images.
- The grid uses only thumb URLs.
- DB size stops growing with images.
- Object storage is canonical.
- Verification prevents migrating corrupted/stale/incorrect data.
