You are working inside the Style Vault React + TypeScript application.

Your task is to improve the Style Explorer page UX while preserving downstream prompt fidelity.

PRIMARY GOAL
Transform the Explorer into a visual-first browsing experience that treats styles as visual artifacts, not data records.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- Do NOT add filters, search, or new APIs
- Do NOT expose tokens, metadata tags, CV analysis, or technical language
- Do NOT change backend schemas or responses

STYLE EXPLORER CARD REQUIREMENTS
Each style card must display ONLY:
- Preview image (primary visual anchor)
- Style name
- One-line aesthetic summary written in natural language
- Creation date

Explicitly remove:
- Metadata tags
- Token counts
- Analysis indicators
- Any technical or system-facing terminology

The Explorer page must feel like a visual gallery, not a database.

EMPTY STATE
Add an empty state with explanatory copy that answers:
“What is a style?”

Example intent (do not copy verbatim):
A style is a reusable visual language capturing color, mood, and form — not just an image or a prompt.

LOADING STATE
Implement skeleton loading that is isomorphic to the final card layout:
- Same image aspect ratio
- Same title line
- Same summary line
- Same date position

No placeholder chips, tags, or fake metadata.

HOVER AFFORDANCE
Add a subtle, non-intrusive hover affordance that signals “click to inspect”:
- Light elevation or scale (1–2%)
- Soft shadow or motion
- No buttons, icons, overlays, or text labels

If the card looks interactive, you have gone too far.

METADATA HANDLING (CRITICAL)
Metadata tags must NOT be shown in Explorer.

Instead:
- Metadata continues to exist in the data model
- Metadata must influence prompt generation automatically downstream
- Metadata should surface only in:
  1. Style Inspection (as explanatory “Visual DNA”)
  2. Generation (as optional, click-to-emphasize prompt language)

Explorer is for recognition.
Generation is for language.
Inspection is for understanding.

DO NOT add new UI for metadata in Explorer.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Explorer feels calm, visual, and fast
- Users choose styles by looking, not reading
- Prompt fidelity is preserved through invisible metadata influence
- No cognitive overload during browsing

Deliver clean, readable React code with minimal diff surface.
